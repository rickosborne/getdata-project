Project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

Original code by Rick Osborne, 2014-05-23

The tidied data is in _RData_ format in the [data-tidy](data-tidy) directory, 
while the script used to generate it is [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R).  You 
should not need any special libraries to repeat the process.

Explanations of the data columns are in [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md).

## How the script works

 1. It will attempt to download the data if it is not found in the `data-src` directory.  If the ZIP file is already present in another directory, you can change the `DATA_DIR` variable to point at it.
 2. It will unzip the file, if the `UCI HAR Dataset` directory is not present within the `data-src` directory.
 3. It reads, combines, and summarizes the TXT files in the source dataset.
 4. It creates a `data-tidy` directory in which it saves `RData` formatted files for each of the data frames generated by the previous step.
 5. It compresses the `data-tidy` directory into a ZIP file and removes the directory.
 6. It saves a `data-tidy.txt` file appropriate for submitting to Coursera.
