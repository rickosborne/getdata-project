Project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera

Original code by Rick Osborne, 2014-05-23

The tidied data is in _RData_ format in the [data-tidy](data-tidy) directory, 
while the script used to generate it is [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R).  You 
should not need any special libraries to repeat the process.

Explanations of the data columns are in [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md).
